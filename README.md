# Critical Minerals Recovery: Phase Diagram Analysis Tool

## Overview
The Critical Minerals Recovery Tool is an open-source Python application that generates material phase diagrams to identify valuable minerals in electronic waste streams. By making complex materials science concepts accessible to recycling operators, this tool bridges the gap between academic research and practical e-waste recovery operations.

## The Story Behind the Project

In Spring 2020, my former professor assigned a task to create a binary phase diagram using programming in MATLAB. Though that initiative halted, I never lost that thought.

It would:
-> explain single-component phase diagram as a map of equilibrium phases as a function of state variables (temperature, time, pressure)
-> break it into three stages: cooling to freezing point, the plateau, and additional 

Fall 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging stretches of life. However, during an in-person Introduction to Materials Laboratory, I conducted experiments correlating Tin-Bismuth alloys with their literature-referenced melting temperatures. So, with the right tools, one could identify valuable materials in waste streams through thermal properties and cooling curves.


## Material Science Terms

-> Phase diagram (def.) : plot of solid and liquid phases of matter as a function of temp. and time.
-> It's held at constant pressure
-> There are various concentrations to determine invariant points 

Example Tin (Sample A) and Bismuth (Sample B) has following concentrations: 

100% A
75% A - 25%B
50-50%
25% A - 75% B

Why Phase Diagrams Matter for E-waste:
Different electronic components melt at specific temperatures based on their composition. By identifying these "thermal signatures," we can determine what valuable materials are present and in what quantities.

-> Alloying alters how phase changes show up and the diagramâ€™s melting range

By measuring how a sample melts, we can identify its composition and extract valuable minerals accordingly.


## Unlocking Critical Minerals from Electronic Waste Challenge Statement

Five years later, in 2025, I revisited that old lab report with a new purpose. During NYC's Circular Supply Chain and Critical Minerals Hackathon, this concept was transformed from academic exercise to industry-backed innovation, focused on one of our most pressing environmental challenges: electronic waste.

## Mission: Create a Python application that acts as a materials phase diagram generator and identifies critical materials based on datasets provided.

Tin and Bismuth can be linked to a phase diagram. 
Alloy (def.): a composition of two elements, and the atomic structure is different at varying temperatures.

The outcome of a Python / data-drive application could be a visualization of a binary phase diagram of Tin and Bismuth. [https://www.britannica.com/science/tin](url)

This will assist users in identifying a critical electronic material to recycle through thermal techniques and investigation
The researcher can answer Y/N to the melting temperatures provided. 
Then it will run through a basic prompt that a researcher or manual labor worker would use to determine the weight percent of that material.

### Ideal Outcomes

- Build a tool that can sustainably source materials in a supply chain
- Deliver supply chain insights through a tool
- User interface can be text-based that gives options to enter. It will end up with a tailored recommendation.
- Incorporate pull requests for volunteers and product user feedback mechanisms to improve tool performance.
