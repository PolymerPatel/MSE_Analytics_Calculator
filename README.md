## Backstory

In Spring 2020, my former professor assigned a task to create a binary phase diagram using programming in MATLAB.

The deliverable that did not come to fruition would
-> explain single-component phase diagram as a map of equilibrium phases as a function of state variables (temperature, time, pressure)

	-> break it into three stages: cooling to freezing point, the plateau, and additional 

MATLAB was never a strong suit, and this project did not align. That idea stagnated.

Fall 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging stretches of life. 

Introduction to Materials Laboratory was in-person, and one of the lab experiments utilized a phase diagram to correlate a critical mineral alloy of Tin and Bismuth with literature referenced melting temperature.

# Material Science Jargon

-> Phase diagram (def.) : plot of solid and liquid phases of matter as a function of temp. and time.
-> It's held at constant pressure
-> There are various concentrations to determine invariant points 

Example Tin (Sample A) and Bismuth (Sample B) has following concentrations: 

100% A
75% A - 25%B
50-50%
25% A - 75% B

	-> Alloying alters how phase changes show up and the diagramâ€™s melting range


Now, in 2025, PolymerPatel revisited that lab report to create a proposal and this project was industry approved during a Critical Minerals - Circular Supply Chain Hackathon.

This is a start to build knowledge tools to make an impact on environmental sustainability. [https://hackaday.com/2019/02/20/the-woeful-world-of-worldwide-e-waste/](url)

## Unlocking Critical Minerals from Electronic Waste Challenge Statement

Uncover the value of critical minerals in electronic waste products


## Mission: Create a Python application that acts as a materials phase diagram generator and identifies critical materials based on datasets provided.

Tin and Bismuth can be linked to a phase diagram. 
Alloy (def.): a composition of two elements, and the atomic structure is different at varying temperatures.
Lithium e-bike batteries and transit waste applications [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X1630530X](url)

The outcome of a Python / data-drive application could be a visualization of a binary phase diagram of Tin and Bismuth. [https://www.britannica.com/science/tin](url)

This will assist users in identifying a critical electronic material to recycle through thermal techniques and investigation
The researcher can answer Y/N to the melting temperatures provided. 
Then it will run through a basic prompt that a researcher or manual labor worker would use to determine the weight percent of that material.

# Ideal Outcomes

- Build a tool that can sustainably source materials in a supply chain
- Deliver supply chain insights through a tool
- User interface can be text-based that gives options to enter. It will end up with a tailored recommendation.
- Incorporate pull requests for volunteers and product user feedback mechanisms to improve tool performance.






GOAL: An MSE analytical tool calculator with phase diagrams incorporated beginnning April 2025 to Summer 2025.
