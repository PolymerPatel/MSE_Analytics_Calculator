# üåä Critical Minerals Recovery: Phase Diagram Analysis Tool

## üìù Overview
This is a Python application that generates Material phase diagrams to identify valuable minerals in electronic waste streams. <br><br> By making complex materials science concepts accessible to recycling operators, this tool bridges the gap between academic research and practical e-waste recovery operations.

## üí° Background

In Spring 2020, my former professor assigned a task to create a binary phase diagram using programming in MATLAB. 
<br> Although that project stalled, I never lost that thought.

Goals:<br>
-> explain a single-component phase diagram as a map of equilibrium phases as a function of state variables (temperature, time, pressure)<br>
-> break it into three stages: cooling to freezing point, the plateau, and additional

Fall 2020 was one of the most uncertain and challenging stretches in PolymerPatel's life. <br><br> However, during Materials Laboratory, I conducted experiments correlating Tin-Bismuth alloys with their literature-referenced melting temperatures. It demonstrated that one could identify valuable materials in waste streams through thermal properties and cooling curves.


## üß™ Material Science Terms

Phase diagram (def.): plot of solid and liquid phases of matter as a function of temp. and time. <br><br>

 -> It's held at constant pressure <br>
 -> There are various concentrations to determine invariant points
  -> Tin and Bismuth can be linked to a phase diagram.<br><br>
Alloy (def.): a composition of two elements, and the atomic structure is different at varying temperatures. <br><br>

In that experiment, Tin (Sample A) and Bismuth (Sample B) had following concentrations:
 - 100% A<br><br>
 - 75% A - 25%B<br><br>
 - 50-50%<br><br>
 - 25% A - 75% B<br><br>

 -> Alloying altered how phase changes show up and the diagram‚Äôs melting range

-- Different electronic components melt at specific temperatures based on their composition. <br>-- And by identifying these "thermal signatures," we can determine what valuable materials are present and in what quantities.

By measuring how a sample melts, we can identify its composition and extract valuable minerals accordingly.


## NYC Hackathon

In 2025, I reflected on my former lab report. <br><br> And, during NYC's Circular Supply Chain and Critical Minerals Hackathon, this concept started to come to fruition.<br>

Challenge statement: Uncover the value of critical minerals in electronic waste products

## üéØ Mission

Create a Python application that acts as a materials phase diagram generator and identifies critical materials based on datasets provided.

The outcome of a Python / data-drive application could be a visualization of a binary phase diagram of Tin and Bismuth. [https://www.britannica.com/science/tin](url)

This will assist users in identifying a critical electronic material to recycle through thermal techniques and investigation. <br><br>
The researcher can answer Y/N to the melting temperatures provided. <br><br>
Then it will run through a basic prompt that a researcher or manual labor worker would use to determine the weight percent of that material.

## üöÄ Tasks

- Build a tool that can sustainably source materials in a supply chain <br>
- Deliver supply chain insights through a tool <br>
- User interface can be text-based that gives options to enter. It will end up with a tailored recommendation <br>
- Incorporate pull requests for volunteers and product user feedback mechanisms to improve tool performance <br>
